# Google Hash Code

[Google Hash Code](https://hashcode.withgoogle.com/) is a programming competition for teams of 2-4 people.

## 2021 (Academic code is rubbish â™») - [Certificate](./GoogleHashCode2021/GoogleHashCodeCertificate2021.pdf)

In 2021, I paired up with another friend of mine and we managed to successfully solve the problem with a pretty good score of 9,537,270 points.

We ended up on 558th place (top 6.2%) worldwide, 15th in the UK, and 2nd in our University Hub with around 19.5k points less than the 1st place.

## 2020

We failed during the competition due to bug in input parser we could not find.

In the extended round, after the qualification finished, I rewrote the Java code into C# which you can find in the [GoogleHashCode2020](./GoogleHashCode2020/) folder.
